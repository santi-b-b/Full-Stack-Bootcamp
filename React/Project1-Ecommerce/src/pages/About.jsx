        About Us
      </h2>

      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-12">
        We are a small design studio dedicated to creating timeless everyday
        objects. Our work explores the balance between function and emotion â€”
        minimal pieces made to be lived with, not just looked at.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-12">
        Every item is designed with care and crafted in collaboration with
        independent makers. We believe in small-scale production, honest
        materials, and quiet aesthetics that invite calm and presence.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
        Based in Berlin, we ship worldwide and continue to grow through
        curiosity, collaboration, and a deep respect for design as a way of
        connecting with others.
      </p>
